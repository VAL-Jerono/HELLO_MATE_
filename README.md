# **Understanding Love & Relationships: A Data-Driven Approach**  

## **Project Overview**  
This project explores the dynamics of love, relationships, and societal attitudes using real-world data. The analysis aims to answer key questions about how people seek love, what sustains relationships, and what factors contribute to relationship failure.  

## **Objectives**  
- Determine how many people actively seek love.  
- Analyze whether love remains a growing need in society.  
- Identify key factors in partner selection.  
- Investigate what sustains long-term relationships.  
- Examine common reasons for relationship failure.  
- Assess gender differences in love-related hesitation.  
- Explore societal factors that support or hinder love.  

## **Datasets Used**  
1. **Affairs Dataset** – Contains information on marital affairs and relationship satisfaction.  
2. **Divorce Dataset** – Includes factors contributing to divorce and relationship conflicts.  
3. **Divorces (2000-2015) Dataset** – Provides demographic and legal details of divorces over time.  
4. **Marriage & Divorce Compatibility Database** – Measures compatibility factors such as loyalty, social similarities, and financial stability.  
5. **Speed Dating Dataset** – Captures dating preferences and decision-making patterns.  
6. **Violence Dataset** – Examines societal attitudes toward relationships and gender norms.  

## **Key Findings**  

### **1. Desire for Love**  
- **75% of individuals** in the **Affairs dataset** reported no extramarital affairs, indicating a preference for committed relationships.  
- **8,378 participants** took part in **Speed Dating**, suggesting an active search for companionship.  

### **2. Is Love a Growing Need?**  
- Marriage remains **a constant human desire**, despite shifts in relationship patterns.  

### **3. Factors in Partner Selection**  
- **Attractiveness, intelligence, and playfulness** are the top criteria for choosing a partner.  
- **Financial and social compatibility** also play a role in long-term relationship success.  

### **4. Relationship Longevity Factors**  
- **Common interests (74.9%)**, **loyalty (62%)**, and **financial stability (57%)** contribute to long-term commitment.  

### **5. Relationship Failure Factors**  
- **Stubbornness and refusal to compromise (2.74 avg score)**  
- **Accusations and blame (2.38 avg score)**  
- **Silent treatment due to fear or anger (2.27 avg score)**  
- **Feelings of inadequacy (2.24 avg score)**  

### **6. Gender-Based Hesitation in Love**  
- **Men and women hesitate at similar rates (~83.5%)** when deciding on potential partners.  

### **7. Societal Factors Affecting Love**  
- **Cultural norms in some regions justify relationship violence**, making emotional security a challenge.  
- **Educating communities, promoting emotional openness, and strengthening relationship norms** can help foster a society where love thrives.  

## **Tools & Techniques Used**  
- **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)** – Data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.  
- **Hypothesis Testing** – Formulating and verifying relationship insights.  
- **Statistical Analysis** – Measuring trends in love, dating, and breakups.  
- **Data Preprocessing** – Handling missing values and encoding inconsistencies.  

## **Next Steps: Advanced Technical Challenges**  

### **1. Predicting Relationship Longevity (Intermediate Difficulty)**  
- Implement **Machine Learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forests)** to predict whether a relationship will last based on compatibility scores.  

### **2. Social & Emotional Sentiment Analysis (Advanced Difficulty)**  
- Use **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to analyze sentiment in relationship-related text data (e.g., social media posts, dating app messages).  

### **3. AI-Powered Love Compatibility Model (Expert Level)**  
- Develop an **AI-driven compatibility score** using clustering and deep learning, integrating data from the Speed Dating and Marriage Compatibility datasets.  

## **Conclusion**  
- Love is a fundamental human experience, influenced by individual preferences, societal norms, and emotional security. This project demonstrates how data analysis can help us understand and improve relationships by identifying key factors that sustain or hinder love.  

- Further research into predictive modeling and sentiment analysis could enhance relationship compatibility tools and provide deeper insights into modern dating behaviors
